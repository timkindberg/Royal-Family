# Royal Family

Two royal families race to destroy each other. An open source table top game that requires only a normal deck of cards.

#### Two Players

### Card Designations

- Aces are Castles
- King, Queen, Jack are Royal Family Members
- 3–10 can be various, i.e. Soldiers, Damage Points, Pursuasion/Threat Points
- 2 is an Assassin
- Joker toggles the [Age](#round-breakdown)

### Setup: 

1. Get a normal 52 count card deck. Keep the Jokers in the deck.
1. Each player starts with two castles of the same color (Ace cards):
  - Player One (Black):
    - The Starless family, their crest is the Spade &#9824;️️. The crest of their alliance family is the Club &#9827;.
    - Player One starts with both black castles placed in front of them—**Spade face up and Club face down**. The Spade castle starts fully developed and the Club castle is not yet developed.
  - Player Two (Red):
    - The Scarlett family, their primary crest is the Heart &#9825;. The crest of their alliance family is the Diamond &#9826;.
    - Player Two starts with both red castles placed in front of them—**Heart face up and Diamond face down**. The Heart castle starts fully developed and the Diamond castle is not yet developed.
1. Shuffle the remaining deck and place the deck to the side, face down. 
1. Deal the first round's flop—face up—between the two players. This is "The Field".
1. Final setup should look as like this:

```
                     Ace 2   Ace 1
                     Down     Up
           
Dis-   The              The Field     
Card   Deck     Card 1 | Card 2 | Card 3
Up     Down       Up   |   Up   |   Up

                     Ace 1   Ace 2
                      Up     Down
```

### Winning

⚑⚑⚑⚑

A player wins when their opponent has no active castles.

### Game Play Overview

The game is played in a continuous series of [Rounds](#round-breakdown) until the [winning objective](#winning) is met by a player.

#### Round Breakdown

A round consists of:

1. The "Flop": 
  1. Deal: Deal three cards from the deck to the field.
  1. Resolve Age Change: If any of the three cards is a Joker, move it off to the side opposite the deck and replace it with a new card from the deck. If a joker is already present there, then discard both jokers. This shows where the Joker is to be placed:
  ```
  The              The Field          
  Deck     Card 1 | Card 2 | Card 3    Joker
  Down       Up   |   Up   |   Up
  ```
  1. If there are not enough cards to fill the field, then collect up all the cards from the field and discard piles (leave Jokers in play), shuffle, place the deck back and start over with a new flop.
1. Determine the current "Age": 
  - "Age of Uprising" if the Joker is __not__ present.
  - "Age of Oppression" if the Joker __is__ present.
1. Determine Turn Order: A round consists of three (3) turns. One of the players gets the 1st and 3rd turn. The other player gets the 2nd turn. Turn order is dependent on the current age.
  1. First look at the three cards in the field. Count how many red cards and how many black cards.
  2. If it's the Age of Uprising, then the player with the __lower__ count goes 1st and 3rd, the other player goes 2nd.
  3. If it's the Age of Oppression, then the player with the __higher__ count goes 1st and 3rd, the other player goes 2nd.
1. Players take their turns determined by the turn order.
1. End of Round

#### Turn Breakdown:

1. Draw: Take any one card from any one of the field piles or the deck. If the deck or some field piles are empty, just draw from another pile that has cards.
2. Take an [Action](#actions)

### Actions

##### Number Card Actions (2–10):

Number cards can be used to perform a variety of actions:

- [Pursuade or Threaten](#pursuade-or-threaten)
- [Defend](#defend)
- [Attack](#attack)
- [Field](#field)

###### Pursuade or Threaten

Your alliance needs some pursuasion to convince them to war with you. Once pursuaded it will give you access to all of it's soldiers. You can perform all the same actions with your alliance kingdom that you can with your own. On the flip side, you can threaten your opponent's alliance. Intimidate them to prevent them from joining in the war.

1. **Pursuade Your Alliance:** Place a card that matches your alliance suit on top of your alliance's inactive face down castle. The number on the card represent the amount of pursuasion points applied to your alliance. Once you place at least twenty (20) pursuasion points on your alliance castle it becomes active—flip the castle face up and discard all pursuasion and threat cards. An active castle can no longer be threatened, they are in it to win it, victory or death!
1. **Threaten Your Opponent's Alliance:** Place a card that matches any of your active castle suits on your opponent alliance's face down castle. Threat points cancel out pursuasion. If you cancel out all pursuasion, discard all the pursuasion and threat cards.

> Squaring Up Points: If at any time you can discard an even amount of pursuasion (+) and threat (-) point cards, do so. E.g. There is +9 and -9. Discard both cards since they cancel each other out. E.g. There is +4, +5, and -9. Discard all three cards, since they also cancel out. Otherwise, just keep all cards there and keep a running total.

###### Defend

Defense is represented by "Fortifications"—a wall of soldiers standing in defense of your castle. Fortifications must match the suit of the castle they are defending. They will help protect against future attacks. The larger the number on the card, the stronger its defense. You may only have one (1) active fortification per castle at any time. Different defense options are:

1. **Fortify a castle:** Place the card above the castle with matching suit. Place it sideways to signify a wall.
1. **Upgrade a Fortification:** You may upgrade a fortification by replacing it with a higher number card (still of matching castle suit). The old card is discard.
1. **Repair a Fortification:** You may repair a damaged fortification by replacing it and all damage with a new fortification card (still of matching castle suit). The old card and damage cards are all discarded.

###### Attack

Attack with an army of soldiers. You can command your armies to attack your opponent. If your opponent has fortifications then you must destroy those first before you can apply permanent damage to their castles. Different attack options are:

1. **Attack a Fortification:** 
1. **Attack a Castle:** You must have at least one family member present in your castle to be able to attack. If you do, then if you've drawn a number card that matches the suit of an **opponent castle**, you can declare an attack on the other player's castle. Hand them the card and have them resolve the attack, see next sub-section.
  - **Resolving an Attack:** The attacked player resolves the attack. They either:
    - **Defend:** Use a number card that is currently fortifying the attacked castle to cancel out the attack. The fortification card must be equal or greater than the attack number card.
    - **Take Castle Damage:** If the player cannot **Defend** then they place the attack number card to the side of the castle card. The castle now has that number of damage. When a castle take twenty (20) damage it is destroyed. The attacker can then choose one of two optional bonus actions:
      - **Rescue:** If there are any kidnapped family members in the attacked castle, rescue one (1) and place it in their castle.
      - **Injure:** If there are any opponent family members living in the attacked castle, choose one (1) and place it in one of the three face-up discard piles. 

###### Field

1. **Field:** If the player doesn't want to, or can't do anything else, they __must__ "field" the card. To "Field", place the card face-up on one of the three field piles.

> Fielding can actually be a major part of the game. It's often wise to pick up a card for the sole purpose of discarding it to cover up a powerful opponent card that you don't want them to draw.

##### Royal Family Card Actions (King, Queen, Jack):
1. **Bring Home:** If the card **matches the suit of a castle in your possession**, you may place it in on top of **that** castle (leave the Ace showing a bit out the top of the face card). That family member adds one of the following benefits:
  - **King - "Morale"**: When the King is home the whole kingdom gets a morale boost.
    - The defending army fights harder. **All of your fortifications gain +2 in the king's matching castle.** 
    - The alliance army helps defend. **You may use your alliance family cards to fortify the king's matching castle.**
  - **Queen - "Hospitality"** - The Queen is a master of politics.
    - The Queen knows that even in war you must treat your enemies with respect. She treats the kidnapped royal family members as they deserve; like royalty. **You may kidnap up to three opponent family members in the queen's matching castle instead of just one.**
    - The Queen casts doubt into the alliance of her enemy. **The opponent's alliance cards are affected ???**
  - **Jack - "Cunning"** - The Prince's youthful cunning nature extends to his war plans.
    - His strategies are flexible and make use of deceitful and creative attacks. **You can attack with either suit of the opponent's color.**
    - His attacks are fierce: **All attacks of the suit matching the attacked castle gain +1.**
2. **Kidnap:** If the card **matches the suit of an opponent castle**, you may place it below (not under) one of your castles. You may only kidnap one person per castle (unless you have the Queen). If you already have the max allowed kidnapped, you can choose which to keep kidnapped and which to release (discard). The opponent will have a chance to rescue the family member when they attack. Read the Attack section.
3. **Discard:** If you don't want to or can't do the other actions, then you may place the card on one of the three face-up piles between the two castles.

##### Castle Card Actions (Ace)

Take one of the following actions:

- **Inspire Another Kingdom + Extra Turn:** If the suit is your alliance family's suit, you may place it next to your first castle. Then take an extra turn. You now have two castles. You can do all the things to the 2nd that you could do to the first. The opponent must now destroy both to win.
- **Discard + Extra Turn:** If the suit **matches your opponent color** you discard it. Then take an extra turn. Perhaps this is a good chance to cover that castle up with another card ;) but you don't have to.

##### Assassin Card Actions (Joker)

- **Assassinate + Extra Turn:** If the opponent has at least one family member in a castle you can play this card to assassinate that person. You must discard the assassinated family member to one of the piles. Then **permanently** discard the Joker. Take an extra turn. Perhaps cover that face card up ;)
- **Discard + Extra Turn:** If the opponent does not have any family members to assassinate then discard the Joker to one of the three face-up piles. Take an extra turn.

### Rules I'm Questioning:

- All number based rules are up for tweaking: 20hp for castles, +2 king bonus, etc.
- Needing at least 1 family member to be able to attack. I wonder if they should need zero instead. It's worth trying both ways and see which is better.
- Attacking requires the suit of the castle you want to attack. I wonder if an attack should be made with the suit that matches the own player's castle. This way the player must choose between fortification and attacking, but then we may need better options for all the other suits.
- At the start both clubs and diamonds can really only be discarded. It's minorly helpful because you can cover up cards that your opponent may want but there may be more interesting options we could think of.
  - Perhaps, for example, if you are Hearts you could use the other red color, Diamonds, to start building the foundation of your new castle. If you collect a pattern or sum then you get to find and take out the Diamond Ace and build your castle. The pattern could be 3-card straight, or maybe a sum of 10 or 15 or something, or just 5? of any diamond card.
- The jack's benefit becomes less special once the player has two castles
- Even allowing building of another castle, I'm pretty blurry about how that will affect overall game play.
- Maybe the King's "Morale" benefit should allow both suits as fortifications instead of +2. This would balance the Jack's attack benefit that allows both suits.
- The various rules around discarding cards and covering them up are troublesome, because then the next player can choose to uncover the card, but then the next player can just cover it up again. There can be an infinite loop of cover then uncover until someone just gives up.
- Any rule really...
